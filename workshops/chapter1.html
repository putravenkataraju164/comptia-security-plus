        <h2 is-upgraded>Malware</h2>
		<p>&#34;Malware (malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network&#34;</p>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Types of malware</h2>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Virus:</b> A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code.</li>
		<li><b>Worms:</b> A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers using vulnerable computer network to spread itself</li>
		<li><b>Trojan Horses:</b> A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software.</li>
		<li><b>Adware:</b> Malware that generates revenue for its developer by automatically generating online advertisements.</li>
		<li><b>Spyware:</b> Spyware is a software that aims to gather information about a person or organization, without their knowledge, and send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent</li>
		<li><b>Ransomware:</b> Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.</li>
		<li><b>Backdoor:</b> A backdoor is a malicious computer program used to provide the attacker with unauthorized remote access to a compromised PC by exploiting security vulnerabilities.</li>
		<li><b>Logic Bomb:</b> A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met</li>
		<li><b>Rootkit:</b> A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed and often masks its existence or the existence of other software.</li>
		<li><b>Botnets:</b> A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform DDoS attack, steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control (C&C) via IRC, Twitter and Pear-to-Pear communication</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Prevention</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Install an anti-virus/anti-malware software</li>
		<li>Turn on your firewall</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Advanced Malware" duration="3">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Polymorphic Malware</h2>
		<p>Malware that constantly changes its identifiable features in order to evade detection. Polymorphic techniques involve frequently changing identifiable characteristics like file names and types or encryption keys to make the malware unrecognizable to many detection techniques.</p>
     	<p>Polymorphism is used to evade pattern-matching detection relied on by security solutions like antivirus software. While certain characteristics of polymorphic malware change, its functional purpose remains the same.</p>
        <aside class="special"><p><strong>Example:</strong> A polymorphic virus will continue to spread and infect devices even if its signature changes to avoid detection. By changing characteristics to generate a new signature, signature-based detection solutions will not recognize the file as malicious. Even if the new signature is identified and added to antivirus solutions’ signature database, polymorphic malware can continue to change signatures and carry out attacks without being detected.</p>
		</aside>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Armored Malware</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Prevent Reverse Engineering</li>
		<li>Obfuscated Assembly Code</li>
		<li>Blocking use of system debuggers</li>
		<li>Preventing use of sandboxing</li>

	  <h2 is-upgraded>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</h2>
	  <p>In a distributed denial-of-service attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single source.</p>

			<ul>
			<li>Requires more bandwidth</li>
			<li>Easy to block based on IP addresses</li>
			</ul>
			</aside>
			<h2 is-upgraded>Examples:</h2>
	 <aside class="special"><p><strong>Ping Flood Attack</strong> A ping flood is a denial-of-service attack in which the attacker attempts to overwhelm a targeted device with ICMP echo-request packets, causing the target to become inaccessible to normal traffic. When the attack traffic comes from multiple devices, the attack becomes a DDoS or distributed denial-of-service attack.</p>
	 <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 400.00px" "height: 400.00px" src="../chap1/ping-icmp.png"></p>
	 </aside>
	 <aside class="special"><p><strong>Smurf Attack</strong> The Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intended victim's spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address</p>
	 <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 400.00px" "height: 450.00px" src="../chap1/smurf-attack.png"></p>
	 </aside>
	 <h2 is-upgraded>Eavesdropping Attack</h2>
	 <p>An eavesdropping attack, which are also known as a sniffing or snooping attack, is an incursion where someone tries to steal information that computers, smartphones, or other devices transmit over a network.</p>
