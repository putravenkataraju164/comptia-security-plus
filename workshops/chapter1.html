        <p>The first domain in CompTIA’s Security + exam (SYO-501) covers threats, attacks and vulnerabilities. This domain contributes 21 percent of the exam score. The exam’s objectives are covered through knowledge, application and comprehension, and the exam has both multiple-choice and performance-based questions. The performance-based questions are designed to test the candidate’s ability to troubleshoot problems in a simulated environment.</p>
			<h2 is-upgraded>What you&#39;ll learn</h2>
			<p>You will be learning different types of security compromises, the types of actors involved, and the concepts of penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.</p>
			<h2 class="checklist" is-upgraded>The module covers the following sections</h2>
			<ul class="checklist">
			<li>Given a scenario, analyse indicators of compromise and determine the type of malware</li>
			<li>Compare and contrast types of attacks</li>
			<li>Explain threat actor types and attributes</li>
			<li>Explain penetration testing concepts</li>
			<li>Explain vulnerability scanning concepts</li>
			<li>Explain the impact associated with types of vulnerabilities</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="checklist" is-upgraded>Contents</h2>
			<ul class="checklist">
			<li>Types of Malware</li>
			<li>Understanding Attacks</li>
			<li>Understanding Attack Types</li>
			<li>Wireless Attacks</li>
			<li>Application Attacks</li>

		   <h2 is-upgraded>Threat</h2>
		   <p>A threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability to breach security and therefore cause possible harm.</p>
		   <h2 is-upgraded>Attack</h2>
		   <p>An attack is any attempt to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an asset.</p>
		   <h2 is-upgraded>Vulnerability</h2>
		   <p>A vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor (attacker), to perform unauthorized actions within a computer system.</p>
		   <h2 is-upgraded>Exploit</h2>
		   <p>An exploit is a piece of code, data or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to a computer resource.</p>
		   <h2 is-upgraded>C.I.A Triad</h2>
		   <p>CIA triad is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization.</p>
		   <p>The elements of the triad are considered the three most crucial components of security.</p>
		   <p class="image-container"><img style="width: 450.00px" src="../chap1/cia-traid.png"></p>
		   <h2 is-upgraded>A-A-A</h2>
		   <p>A-A-A refers to Authentication, Authorization and Accounting</p>
		   <p><b>Authentication:</b><pre><code> Process that ensures and confirms a user’s identity</code></pre></p>
		   <p><b>Authorization:</b><pre><code> Is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources</code></pre></p>
		   <p><b>Accounting:</b><pre><code> The process of logging the actions the user took while accessing the resources</code></pre></p>

		  <google-codelab-step label="Malware" duration="7">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Malware</h2>
		<p>&#34;Malware (malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network&#34;</p>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Types of malware</h2>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Virus:</b> A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code.</li>
		<li><b>Worms:</b> A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers using vulnerable computer network to spread itself</li>
		<li><b>Trojan Horses:</b> A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software.</li>
		<li><b>Adware:</b> Malware that generates revenue for its developer by automatically generating online advertisements.</li>
		<li><b>Spyware:</b> Spyware is a software that aims to gather information about a person or organization, without their knowledge, and send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent</li>
		<li><b>Ransomware:</b> Ransomware is a type of malware from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.</li>
		<li><b>Backdoor:</b> A backdoor is a malicious computer program used to provide the attacker with unauthorized remote access to a compromised PC by exploiting security vulnerabilities.</li>
		<li><b>Logic Bomb:</b> A logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met</li>
		<li><b>Rootkit:</b> A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed and often masks its existence or the existence of other software.</li>
		<li><b>Botnets:</b> A botnet is a number of Internet-connected devices, each of which is running one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform DDoS attack, steal data, send spam, and allows the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control (C&C) via IRC, Twitter and Pear-to-Pear communication</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Prevention</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Install an anti-virus/anti-malware software</li>
		<li>Turn on your firewall</li>
		<li>Ensure that all security updates and patches are installed </li>
		<li>Avoid suspicious links, emails and websites</li>
		<li>Review software carefully before downloading </li>
		</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Advanced Malware" duration="3">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Polymorphic Malware</h2>
		<p>Malware that constantly changes its identifiable features in order to evade detection. Polymorphic techniques involve frequently changing identifiable characteristics like file names and types or encryption keys to make the malware unrecognizable to many detection techniques.</p>
     	<p>Polymorphism is used to evade pattern-matching detection relied on by security solutions like antivirus software. While certain characteristics of polymorphic malware change, its functional purpose remains the same.</p>
        <aside class="special"><p><strong>Example:</strong> A polymorphic virus will continue to spread and infect devices even if its signature changes to avoid detection. By changing characteristics to generate a new signature, signature-based detection solutions will not recognize the file as malicious. Even if the new signature is identified and added to antivirus solutions’ signature database, polymorphic malware can continue to change signatures and carry out attacks without being detected.</p>
		</aside>
		<h2 is-upgraded>Armored Malware</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Prevent Reverse Engineering</li>
		<li>Obfuscated Assembly Code</li>
		<li>Blocking use of system debuggers</li>
		<li>Preventing use of sandboxing</li>
		</ul>
